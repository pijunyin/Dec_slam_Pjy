# Dec_slam

This is a additional code folder of my blog on Zhihu and csdn, I split the whole slam project into such pieces just to help you learn how to write a slam programe from zero(When I wrote this sentence,I cannot do it).
If you only want to use a complete project like Orb_slam2, you will of course meet difficulties in revising some codes and missing the beauties in small places. If you want to be strong from bottom and become a great robotic I suggest start from bottom.
